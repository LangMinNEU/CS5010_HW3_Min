# CS5010 HW3 Functional Programming

## Summary
This is a simple application that reads CSV file and allows users to interact with it, including filtering and exporting results to another file. <br>
A user can
1. filter the minimum price, minimum number of rooms (accommodates), and/or minimum review scores.
2. export the filtered result to another file of user's choice.
3. exit the program.

Note that the program will automatically, based on the filter values, calculate 
1. the number of listings fall into the filter
2. average price per room for each listing
3. the number of total listings are there per host
4. provide a ranking of hosts by number of listings
